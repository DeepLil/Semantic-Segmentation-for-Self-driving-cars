# Semantic-Segmentation-for-Self-driving-cars
Self-driving cars require a deep understanding of their surroundings. To support this, camera frames are used to recognize the road, pedestrians, cars, and sidewalks at a pixel-level accuracy. In this project, we develop a neural network and optimize it to perform semantic segmentation using Unet and Segnets.
